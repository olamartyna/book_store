# {{books}} Model and Repository Classes Design Recipe


## 1. Design and create the Table

If the table is already created in the database, you can skip this step.

Yes, the table is already created in book_store.sql

```
Table: books

Columns:
id | title | author_name
```

## 2. Create Test SQL seeds

Your tests will depend on data stored in PostgreSQL to run.

If seed data is provided (or you already created it), you can skip this step.
Yes, the table is already created in book_store.sql

```sql
-- EXAMPLE
-- (file: spec/book_store.sql)

-- Write your SQL seed here. 

-- First, you'd need to truncate the table - this is so our table is emptied between each test run,
-- so we can start with a fresh state.
-- (RESTART IDENTITY resets the primary key)

TRUNCATE TABLE books RESTART IDENTITY; -- replace with your own table name.

-- Below this line there should only be `INSERT` statements.
-- Replace these statements with your own seed data.

INSERT INTO books (title, author_name) VALUES ('Nineteen Eighty-Four', 'George Orwell');
INSERT INTO books (title, author_name) VALUES ('Mrs Dalloway', 'Virginia Woolf');
INSERT INTO books (title, author_name) VALUES ('Emma', 'Jane Austen');
INSERT INTO books (title, author_name) VALUES ('Dracula', 'Bram Stoker');
INSERT INTO books (title, author_name) VALUES ('The Age of Innocence', 'Edith Wharton');
```

Run this SQL file on the database to truncate (empty) the table, and insert the seed data. Be mindful of the fact any existing records in the table will be deleted.

```bash
psql -h 127.0.0.1 book_store < book_store.sql
```

## 3. Define the class names

Usually, the Model class name will be the capitalised table name (single instead of plural). The same name is then suffixed by `Repository` for the Repository class name.

```python
# Table name: books

# Model class
# (in lib/book.py)
class Book


# Repository class
# (in lib/book_repository.py)
class BookRepository

```

## 4. Implement the Model class

Define the attributes of your Model class. You can usually map the table columns to the attributes of the class, including primary and foreign keys.

```python
# Table name: books

# Model class
# (in lib/book.py)

class Book:
    def __init__(self):
        self.id = 0
        self.title = ""
        self.author_name = ""

        # Replace the attributes by your own columns.


# We can set the attributes to default empty values and set them later,
# here's an example:
#
# >>> student = Student()
# >>> student.name = "Will"
# >>> student.cohort_name = "September Devs"
# >>> student.name
# 'Will'
# >>> student.cohort_name
# 'September Devs'

```

*You may choose to test-drive this class, but unless it contains any more logic than the example above, it is probably not needed.*

## 5. Define the Repository Class interface

Your Repository class will need to implement methods for each "read" or "write" operation you'd like to run against the database.

Using comments, define the method signatures (arguments and return value) and what they do - write up the SQL queries that will be used by each method.

```python
# EXAMPLE
# Table name: books

# Repository class
# (in lib/book_repository.py)

class BookRepository():

    # Selecting all records
    # No arguments
    def all(self):
        # Executes the SQL query:
        # SELECT id, title, author_name FROM books;

        # Returns an array of Book objects.

    def find(self, id):
        # Executes the SQL query:
        # SELECT id, name, author_name FROM books WHERE id = $1;

        # Returns a single Book object.

        # Gets a single record by its ID
        # One argument: the id (number)

        # Add more methods below for each operation you'd like to implement.

    def create(self, book)
        # Executes the SQL query:
        # INSERT INTO books (title, author_name) VALUES ("Frankenstein", "Mary Shelley");

        # Adds a book to the book_store.sql database

    def update(self, id, [title or author_name])
        # Updates a book record 
        # UPDATE books SET title WHERE id = 3;
        # UPDATE books SET author_name WHERE id = 4;

    def delete(self, id)
        # Deletes book from the database
        # DELETE FROM books WHERE id = 2;

```

## 6. Write Test Examples

Write Python code that defines the expected behaviour of the Repository class, following your design from the table written in step 5.

These examples will later be encoded as Pytest tests.

```python
# EXAMPLES

# 1
# Get all books

repo = BookRepository()

books = repo.all()

len(books) # =>  5

books[0].id # =>  1
books[0].title # =>  'Nineteen Eighty-Four'
books[0].author_name # =>  'George Orwell'

books[1].id # =>  2
books[1].title # =>  'Mrs Dalloway'
books[1].cohort_name # =>  'Virginia Woolf'

# 2
# Get a single book

repo = BookRepository()

book = repo.find(1)

book.id[0] # =>  1
book.title[0] # =>  'Nineteen Eighty-Four'
book.cohort_name[0] # =>  'George Orwell'

# Add more examples for each 

# 3
# Create new record / save new book in the databas

repo = BookRepository()

book = repo.create(book)

books[5].id # => 6
books[5].title # => "Frankenstein"
books[5].author_name # => "Mary Shelley"

# 4
# Delete book

repo = BookRepository()

book = repo.delete(id)

book.id[0] # =>  no record
book.title[0] # =>  no record
book.cohort_name[0] # =>  no record

```

Encode this example as a test.


## 7. Test-drive and implement the Repository class behaviour

_After each test you write, follow the test-driving process of red, green, refactor to implement the behaviour._
